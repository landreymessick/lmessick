                    <p> During my free time I love to hangout with my friends. We love to have movie nights, go to
                        cute dinners, and listen to music. My favorite movie is Top Gun because I am a huge
                        Tom Cruise fan. My favorite food is sushi and shrimp. My favorite music is country. I love Zach Bryan 
                        Morgan Wallen. I am also a huge Taylor Swift fan. I also love to swim. I have been swimming for 16 years and 
                        it is something I have always enjoyed. I love to hike at the local hiking trails such as hanging rock.
